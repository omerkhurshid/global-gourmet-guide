One name that kept coming up‚Äîloud, proud, and very often in all caps‚Äîwas Burger O'Clock. \"You have to try their Messy Meat,\" a friend told me.

I paired it with a portion of their infamous Pizza Fries and a chilled soft drink.",

And it delivered. Smoky, spicy, crunchy, messy‚Äîthe flavors were layered beautifully, with just enough heat and creaminess to keep you digging in for more. The Pizza Fries were thick, golden, and loaded with melted mozzarella, tomato sauce, herbs, and bits of pepperoni. They didn't skimp on anything."

            "There's something unpretentious about Burger O'Clock. It doesn't try to imitate an American diner or a high-end burger bar. Instead, it leans into Karachi's love for excess, heat, and flavor. The staff were friendly and fast, the crowd young and loud, and the seating clean but informal.",
            "I sat there watching a group of friends unwrap their Belt Buster‚Äîa towering burger with four patties stacked like a skyscraper‚Äîand it hit me: Burger O'Clock isn't just about food. It's a late-night ritual, a place where hunger meets storytelling, and where calorie-counting takes a temporary back seat."
