One name that kept coming up—loud, proud, and very often in all caps—was Burger O'Clock. \"You have to try their Messy Meat,\" a friend told me. Another raved about their \"insane pizza fries.\" So, one late evening, after unpacking boxes and navigating Karachi's chaotic, electric streets, I decided to find out what the fuss was about.",

The signage was playful, the lights bright, and the promise of comfort food almost magnetic. As I stepped in, I was greeted with the hum of chatter, a flickering kitchen window, and the savory smell of beef patties on the grill."

I paired it with a portion of their infamous Pizza Fries and a chilled soft drink.",
            "When the tray landed at my table, I had a moment of hesitation. This was not a burger you eat delicately. It was a lean forward, roll your sleeves, forget the napkins kind of burger. And it delivered. Smoky, spicy, crunchy, messy—the flavors were layered beautifully, with just enough heat and creaminess to keep you digging in for more. The Pizza Fries were thick, golden, and loaded with melted mozzarella, tomato sauce, herbs, and bits of pepperoni. They didn't skimp on anything."

Instead, it leans into Karachi's love for excess, heat, and flavor. The staff were friendly and fast, the crowd young and loud, and the seating clean but informal.",
            "I sat there watching a group of friends unwrap their Belt Buster—a towering burger with four patties stacked like a skyscraper—and it hit me: Burger O'Clock isn't just about food. It's a late-night ritual, a place where hunger meets storytelling, and where calorie-counting takes a temporary back seat."
